firefox-sync-api-client-ruby-samples
====================================

Just a repo with samples of how to use Firefox Sync API...
Work in progress

The whole idea behind this is to finally have a complete class
for each API provided by firefox sync.

Organization:
 * At the root level, one file for each class:
    * firefox_sync_user_api_client.rb is for the user API
 * In the "test" folder, the unit test files corresponding to the files 
   available at the root level

NOTE:
As I am not an experienced programmer and that it's my first ruby scripts
if you have remarks on the code in a whole, please tell me!
